                    Achieving high marks, attaining a high-income job and then getting rich is what us teenagers are raised to believe is the recipe for a happy and healthy life. In our culture, wealth is life’s most admired achievement. While social media platforms and TV constantly illustrates the glamorous lifestyles of the wealthy, many parents also reinforce this idea by identifying wealth as the determining factor in achieving a good life. This reinforcement is why it is no surprise that 80% of millennials say that “a major life goal” for them is to get rich. But is the key to happiness and good health really as simple as being rich? 
            
                    <br>
                    <br>
            
                        Despite what most of us think, it has been proven that the connection between wealth and happiness is like night and day. Earlier this year, my 85-year-old grandfather wrote a memoir about his life. Every chapter in the book consists of a story about someone he cares for deeply. This revealed to me that what he values the most in life is not the money he made or the job he had, but the relationships he spent a lifetime building. Even today, when I look at what makes him happiest, it’s the warmth of his close relationships with his family and friends. 
            
                    <br>
                    <br>
            
            
                        My grandfather is just one example of many that prove relationships are the key to happiness. A study led by Robert J. Waldinger, an American psychiatrist, analyzed 724 men over the span of 75 years and found that loving relationships were critical to their happiness and health. The men who were the healthiest in their 80’s were the ones with the most satisfying relationships in their 50’s. Being surrounded by authentic relationships is extremely beneficial for the body and brain. On the other hand, some relationships make us feel stressed, confused and empty. These toxic relationships confine and constrain us, inevitably leading to the lethal lane of loneliness.

                    <br>
            
                        Loneliness is like a game of hide-and-seek; most people try to hide from it by having a million friends, but at the end of the day, if these relationships are meaningless and hollow, loneliness will find you. Loneliness is a very dangerous feeling, as it disintegrates one’s health and happiness. In fact, loneliness is proven to be as bad for you as smoking 15 cigarettes a day and increases the risk of death by 29%. However, quality relationships are a shield to the symptoms of loneliness as they make us feel cherished, ultimately keeping us healthy and happy.

                    <br>
            
                        Strong relationships allow us to be comfortable pouring out our over-flowing bottle of problems on to another person. Having something to say but feeling as though nobody is listening is possibly the worst thing a person can feel. Close relationships allow our problems to escape our minds as they give us an outlet to talk about our struggles. This outlet is immensely powerful as it relieves stress improving our contentment and health. Quality relationships are the hands that help us up when we fall and the voice that yells at us to keep ongoing. Not only do relationships improve health and happiness by draining our problems, but they also promote generosity.  
            
            
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Being in relationships that lack generosity is like shopping for a bikini in January, pointless, cold, and miserable. People tend to naturally understand that admirable relationships require acts of generosity. Gary Ingid, a pastor and author, said that “generosity is the practical expression of a loving relationship”. What he means by this is that in order to have a strong, loving relationship, there must be generosity. A study done by the University of Zurich has proven a positive correlation between happiness and generosity. In the study, the people who spent money on others showed significantly more activity in the part of the brain responsible for happiness. The component of generosity in a strong relationship attains a state of happiness. Thus, strong relationships are critical as they force one to be generous which in turn, increases happiness.

                        As teenagers, we are told to bury ourselves in work, get good grades and achieve more. We are told that paying off student debt until we die is what will put a smile on our faces. We are told that the fatter our bank accounts are the healthier and more secure we will feel. And we blindly accept these lies. When in reality, contentment and physical well-being are actually a result of genuine relationships. So, instead of wasting your time stressing over an essay due tomorrow, start investing your time in building strong relationships. After all, you’ve heard it a thousand times: life is short, use your limited time wisely.
