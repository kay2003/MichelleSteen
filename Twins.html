                        For as long as I can remember, people have asked me “how does it feel to be a twin?” My response has always been the same. Being a twin is so normal for me, I am unable to imagine my life any other way. I do not know how being a twin feels, I just know it is who I am. I am a fraternal same-sex girl twin. The normality of being a twin has impacted me in several different ways. From the time I was born, I have always had someone by my side, helping me and being the ultimate competitor to motivate me to do my best. However, being a twin is definitely not all sunshine and rainbows. A study by R. Chris Fraley and Caroline M. Tancredy studies whether twin relationships are actually attachments. A study led by Britta Alin Åkerman and Eve Suurvee analyzed the relationship between co-twins and the development of their identities. A study done by Karen Thorpe and Susan Danby discusses the nature of a twin’s social world and experiences. While it is possible that other circumstantial or genetic factors justify my character, the conclusions made in the articles on the nature of twins exceptionally coincides with my personal behavior.

                        A study led by Chris Fraley and Caroline M. Tancredy evaluated the hypothesis that the relationships between twins are attachments. To test the idea, Tancredy and Fraley developed a 16-item questionnaire, which “[assessed] the extent to which siblings utilize one another as attachment figures” (Fraley, 2011, p. 310). The study used a sample of 900 nontwin siblings and 62 twin siblings and compared the level of attachment found in their relationships using the questionnaire (p. 308). The study found that “twin siblings were more likely than nontwin siblings to be attached to their siblings as they got older” (p. 308). The article states that attachment relationships are characterized by the following four behavioral aspects. First, actively seeking the person with whom they are attached when they have accomplished something or when they feel threatened. Second, experiencing separation distress when the relationship is disrupted. Third, seeking the attachment figure for contact, assurance, and safety in times of distress. Fourth, using the attachment figure to explore new environments (p. 309). I have used self-examination and examples from my own life to determine if I exemplify the factors of attachment in my twin-relationship. The first factor of attachment is desiring the presence of my twin when I feel intimidated. This statement very accurately pertains to my relationship with my twin. For example, I am more likely to participate in activities if my twin is present. The second element of attachment is undergoing separation anguish. This element is accurate for my relationship with my twin, as attending events without my twin present makes me feel uncomfortable. This discomfort can be so extreme that sometimes I will not participate in an activity if my twin is not there. The third aspect of an attachment relationship is seeking my twin when distressed. This statement portrays my experiences as I frequently find myself desiring the comfort of my twin in times of hardship. When I am sad, feel guilty or make a mistake, she is always the person I talk to about it. Lastly, the fourth aspect is using my twin for a sense of security when exposed to new environments. My personal decisions consistently demonstrate this behavior. For example, my twin’s presence always makes me feel more willing to be in new environments. I would even go as far as to say that not only do I very much enjoy my twin’s presence, I require it to be comfortable when in an unfamiliar environment. Based on the four factors of an attachment relationship, I have concluded that my relationship with my twin is an attachment. Thus, Tancredy and Fraley's study accurately describes my personal experiences.

                        A study conducted by Britta Alin Åkerman and Eve Suurvee aimed to “gain a deeper insight into the relationship between co-twins and the development of their identities” (Åkerman, 2003, p. 328). The study was conducted in Stockholm, Sweden and included 32 families and their twins. The twins were observed from birth to 16 years of age. In order to study the twin’s identity development, “self-confidence, self-esteem, social relations, relations to peers and parents, ambitions, power and energy, anxiety, handling of conflicts, defense mechanisms, empathy and aggression” (p. 329), which all play a part in identity, were measured using a psychological method known as the Wartegg drawing test. The Wartegg drawing test involves each twin being asked to complete squares in any way that they wanted. Next, the twins were told to describe what their pictures meant. This test revealed aspects of the twin’s “self-esteem, activity and dominance” (p. 329), which are all traits that influence identity. The study found that it is difficult for twins to develop independence and positive identity, and to do so they must distinguish themselves from their co-twins. Åkerman and Suurvee’s study concluded that “female twins have a dependent relationship with one another and difficulties with their personal identities” (p. 329). Through self-examination and real-life examples, I have concluded that this study pertains to my life situation. The factors of identity stated in the article include self-confidence, self-esteem, social relations, relations to peers and parents, and ambitions. These factors relate to my relationship with my twin. For example, we tend to share friends, and when my twin portrays an act of positive self-confidence or self-esteem, it is reflected on to me. In addition, when writing in my personal diary, I tend to use words like “we” and “us” when describing my day. I am subconsciously referring to myself as indistinguishable from my twin, which indicates my lack of independence. Therefore, this study deeply concerns my behavior as a twin because of its explanation for the development of my identity.

                    A study directed by Karen Thorpe and Susan Danby analyzes the social world of twins. The study consisted of 60 twin children aged 5 to 10 years and their parents. The twins participated in a sticker activity in which they demonstrated their friendships. The children were asked about “their friends, the attributes of friendship and examples of everyday friendships [encounters]” (Thorpe, 2006, p. 103). The parents also completed a questionnaire on their children’s social experiences. The study found that “fraternal same-sex girl twins had the highest level of conflict” (p. 110). The same-sex twin girls reported “conflict, competition, and challenge as types of social interaction” with their co-twin (p. 109). This study relates to my own life as I find myself participating in competition and conflict with my co-twin. I am subconsciously and consciously competing with my twin for things such as better grades and my parent’s approval. I am constantly being compared to her, by my parents and peers, which creates a desire to be better than her. For example, I used to take piano lessons.  I remember that my twin was always a level ahead of me. Her success encouraged me to practice and do better, which resulted in my own success. Consequently, this study accurately depicts my life situation as it provides a reason for my sense of conflict and competition.

                    Overall, the studies “Twin and sibling attachment in a nationally representative sample”, “The Cognitive and Identity Development of Twins at 16 Years of Age”, and “Analyzing Twin Children’s Social Worlds” drastically apply to my personal situation and behavior. The characteristics described in the articles relates to the nature of my relationship with my twin, and my identity and inner conflict. All three studies accurately connect to my own life and provided an explanation as to who I am.
